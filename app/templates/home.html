    <p><strong>Aloha, and Mahalo!</strong> Today, we are going to learn a little bit about "Headless Drupal." This app is meant as a short guide to both "What the heck is Headless Drupal" and How to go about making an application utilizing these concepts. <strong>Spoiler alert, it will look a lot like this one!</strong></p>
    <p>Now, a little bit about this project. This is designed to be a simple, fun app project for folks @ Drupal Camp Baltimore, 2014. We purposefully left this code pretty simple, because, well, it's a project. We would love to DRY up some things, but felt for beginner to intermediate programmers, this may be a little more straightforward. And plus, we ran out of time. Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/rogerseyebyte/EBSheadlessDrupal">Fork This on GitHub</a> if you feel strongly about it, and we will surely pull in worthy commits!</p>
